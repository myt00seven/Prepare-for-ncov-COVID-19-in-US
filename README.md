# Why am I making this post 

A good quote from reddit: 
> The local media where I am is basically saying "stay home if you're stick" and other basic info. I'm honestly not so worried about the virus itself. More the reaction when people start panic shopping. I don't want to have to participate in that. When restaurants are closed because no one will go out to them, or the staff can't work, and the shelves are empty, I will be fine at home.

What's the goal of preparation?
> 1. Be able to shelter in your home for at least two weeks (the longer, the better) without leaving for supplies or outside help. If we have a significant amount of transmission here in the US, you’ll probably want the option of avoiding other people and public places. Or, if things get really dire, it may be recommended or required that you stay in your home for a period of time.
> 2. Be able to protect yourself against picking up the virus. There are steps you can take now, and more serious steps you may want to have ready in case things get much worse.
> 3. Listen to legitimate sources so you can make decisions based on accurate, rational news. This epidemic already has enough actual cause for concern —- there’s no need to make things worse with fake news!

# What to buy 

> Three most important things in survival, good hygiene, daily food, and having lights/electricity.

## Hygiene

- **Tissues**

- Toiletries (**toilet paper**, handwash, soap, detergent, shampoo, , etc.) 

- Prescription meds / basic medical supplies for non-coronavirus stuff. 
  - Mucinex
  - fever reducer
  - vitamin C packets/tabs, Vitamin d3, magnesium and zinc
      - 患上感冒24小时之内迅速补充 [Zinc 锌](https://amzn.to/2PDLBb5)，不但可能减轻感冒症状、而且可能好得更快，可参见这篇文章《[锌的功效和副作用](https://gonglue.us/24478)》。
  - 常见止疼药物是acetaminophen 对乙酰氨基酚，每天用量不应超过 4,000 毫克，常见品牌 Tylenol 泰诺
  - 盐酸洛哌丁胺 loperamide 可降低大肠蠕动，从而减少排便次数，经常用于治疗腹泻，常见品牌 Imodium。然而，如果是因为感染而引起的腹泻，盐酸洛哌丁胺反而可能造成恶化，因此使用前先咨询医生。

      - [Basic medical supplies](https://theprepared.com/homestead/guides/home-medical-supplies-list/)

- Disposable **Gloves**
  - We touch all types of surfaces everyday. Gloves help remind you that you are avoiding contamination because you never forget you are wearing them, so you are more likely to avoid your face.
  - https://www.amazon.com/Cranberry-CR3236-Carbon-Nitrile-Powder/dp/B073V1ZJDS/



- **Trash bags**


- [Eye protection](https://theprepared.com/pick/g-pandemic-dewalt-safety-goggle-amzn/ "DEWALT Safety Goggle - Amzn") 
  - such as industrial safety goggles, swim goggles, or anything that would keep someone else’s sneeze from hitting your eyes (even basic glasses are better than nothing)


- [Tyvek hazmat suit](https://theprepared.com/pick/g-pandemic-dupont-tyvek-coverall-amzn/ "DuPont Tyvek Coverall - Amzn") 
  - (the coveralls you see hospital staff wearing in China) or similar disposable outerwear

- [Plastic sheeting](https://theprepared.com/pick/g-pandemic-plastic-drop-cloth-9-x-12-amzn/ "Plastic Drop Cloth 9 x 12 - Amzn") and [tape](https://theprepared.com/pick/g-pandemic-duct-tape-amzn/ "Duct Tape - Amzn") 
  - to seal air access points to your home (especially if in a shared building).



- **Masks**
  - You want a respirator rated N95 or above (eg. P100).
  - Surgical masks — the common types found at corner stores that are more commonly worn in Asia — are not proper respirators. They are mostly designed to protect other people from you, not the other way around.
  - However, proper respirators are in low supply around the world right now (3M is running their factory 24/7 just to meet urgent medical needs). If the best you can do is a surgical mask, it’s better than nothing.
  - Respirator filters/cartridges don’t last as long as most people think, so buy as many as you reasonably can.
  - A full-face respirator (ie. a gas mask) protects your eyes, nose, and mouth at the same time. If you buy disposable or half-face respirators, you’ll also want separate eye protection.
  - Fit is important — respirators need a tight seal around your face in order to stop bad particles from getting inside.
  - Which means those with facial hair or children with small faces need to be extra careful, since there isn’t a proper seal around the face.

      - 现在 Amazon 上很多 N95 口罩已经断货。告诉大家另外一个购买渠道：家装店。对于美国人来说，这些口罩的一个常见用途是家里刷油漆、翻新地板、做木工活等等，用来防护粉尘。写作本文时，我家附近的 Home Depot、Lowe's、Menards 都还有货：
          *   [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/s/n95%2520masks?NCNI-5)
          *   [Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/search?searchTerm=n95+masks)
      * 美国购买口罩的网站 https://gonglue.us/50934


- Purrell and/or wet wipes/ **Lysol wipes** 
  - (or the Korean equivalent, must say it can kill Human Coronavirus or SARS)
  - for after and/or during touching things like door handles and subway surfaces.
  - 學術研究似乎還沒有證實Lysol Wipes對於COVID19的殺滅效果[FC needed]。

- **Sanitizer** (e.g., alcohol and bleach) / Soap for handwashing
  - **推薦閱讀**: 美国如何选择家庭消毒剂 https://gonglue.us/51321
      - 德国学者一篇新发表的文章显示 \[[来源](https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext?mobileUi=0)\]，严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）、中东呼吸系统综合症（MERS）冠状病毒或地方性人类冠状病毒（HCoV \[**注**\]）可以在无生命的表面（如金属、玻璃或塑料）上生存长达九天，但62%-71%的乙醇（ethanol），0.5%的过氧化氢（hydrogen peroxide）或0.1%的次氯酸钠（sodium hypochlorite）可在一分钟内使病毒灭活。

      - **醇类消毒剂**: 由于美国酒精管制，市售瓶装酒精的成分是异丙醇（Isopropyl Alcohol），其效果同乙醇一样。免洗手部消毒液和某些消毒喷雾的成分是乙醇，毕竟没有人会喝免洗消毒液。消毒酒精在超市药店很容易买到，出门在外可以带些酒精棉片。
          - https://www.amazon.com/Germ-X-Sanitizer-Bottle-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B01HEUD8KW
      - **含氯消毒剂**: 市售漂白水是用途很广的一种消毒液，其有效成分是次氯酸钠（sodium hypochlorite），浓度在5.25%-6%，适用于一般物体表面、白色衣物。漂白水能在短时间内杀菌，大部分情况使用后无需再次清洗，并且价格便宜。(必须**稀释后**才能使用，使用时应戴手套。/ **不能和其他洗涤剂和消毒液混用**，以免产生剧烈化学反应，大量释出氯气。)

          - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RY63RYN
      

      - 美国常见的 Clorox、Lysol 和 store brand 消毒湿巾的有效成分是十二/十四/十八甲基的烷基二甲基苄基氯化铵（alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride），它能杀灭感冒病毒、A2型流感病毒、沙门氏菌、大肠杆菌等，但对新型冠状病毒是否有效尚未确定。
          > 有同学可能会说，我明明看见消毒湿巾上面写着：Kills human corona-virus 呀。冠状病毒是一大类病毒，有些能引起人类比较轻微的症状如普通感冒，有些能引起严重的症状如 SARS, MERS, COVID-19。能杀灭人类冠状病毒不代表能杀灭 COVID-19，还需要更多科学验证。
      - 最容易买到的酚类消毒剂是滴露（Dettol），其有效成分是对氯间二甲苯酚（chloroxylenol）。我来美国前常用，日常家居消毒和衣物消毒都用它。滴露可杀灭引起感冒的人类冠状病毒，但对新型冠状病毒是否有效尚无定论。

## Daily food

- **Bottled water** or water filter
    - It’s very unlikely the tap would run dry, but water is so critical that you never want to risk being without it. Try to reach at least 15 gallons per person (for one gallon per person per day). [Here’s a review of common water containers you can fill from the tap](https://theprepared.com/homestead/reviews/best-two-week-emergency-water-storage-containers/).
- Get frozen vegetables like frozen broccoli, frozen spinach, etc.

[Shelf-stable food](https://theprepared.com/kits/0jh133f5/). Prefer food that doesn’t need more than boiling water to prepare — eg. pasta, oatmeal, rice.
- **Rice** and oatmeal / instant noodles / **dumplings** 
- salt, sugar, soy sauce, sweet soy sauce.
- **Food that you like**
    - There is something that can happen to people in survival situations called food fatigue. People become unable to stomach food that they have eaten repeatedly. Variety and comfort foods are the way to go.
- **cans of food**
    - lots of instant broth (beef, chicken, curry, etc.) / olives
- eggs. 
    - Hard boil a lot of them. Eggs are delicious, nutritious, and most eggs will last in a fridge for a few weeks.
- nuts 

## Lights/electricity

- Enough emergency lamp (2 or 3)
- flashlight
- batteries
- candles
- matches/lighters.

**solar phone charger**

## Optional

- Booze 
- shaving cream

# Where to buy 

- Costco
- Walmart
- local dollar stores
  - for example, a source on reddit said the automotive alcohol wipes are gone from my local dollar stores
- CVS
- Home Depot、Lowe's、Menards (for mask)
